# Koa API Template

## First things first:

### Why use Koa and not Express?
- Koa is more lightweight, with just 500 lines of code;
- Better error handling through try/catch;
- Cleaner, more readable async code;
- Think like that: when you install Express, you buy a complete and ready to consume pizza,  
  when you install Koa, you buy only the dough. So you have to buy all other ingredients  
  manually yourself and mix them with the dough yourself. 🍕
